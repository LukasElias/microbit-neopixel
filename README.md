# Microbit Neopixels for rust

The Micropython port for the micro:bit have a neopixel module. The Makecode micro:bit editor have an extension for neopixel. But the rust crate for [micro:bit](github.com/nrf-rs/microbit) doesn't have a way to interface with neopixels.

This crate allows you to interface with neopixels with rust and the micro:bit.

## Note!

This only works with rgb neopixels. But support for rgbw will be a future feature.
